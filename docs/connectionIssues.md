Troubleshooting connection issues
=================================
### Local Bundled Server
comming soon...

### Tor
You can find a guide to [configuring OpenBazaar to run on Tor here.](https://github.com/OpenBazaar/openbazaar-desktop/wiki/Tor-Setup).

More information is available [in the server Tor documentation if you need it.](https://github.com/OpenBazaar/openbazaar-go/blob/master/docs/tor.md)


### Local Stand-alone Server
1. Ensure the server is running.

### Remote Server
Check your JS console. If you are **not** seeing any red `WebSocket...` errors:

1. Ensure your server is running.
2. In the config file, ensure Addresses.Gateway has your server's IP embedded in it. For example, if your server ip is `123.45.6.78`, the `Gateway` value would be `/ip4/123.45.6.78/tcp/4002`.
3. In the client, ensure the port set in the server configuration UI matches the port value you set above:

4. Check the JSON-API section of your config file. Make sure:
 - Authenticated is true
 - SSL is true (and you have SSL checked in the client's server configuration)
 - SSLCert is the path to your certificate (see the next section for how to set up a certificate)
 - SSLKey is the path to your key
 - Username is your username
5. The password in your config file, in the JSON-API section, must be the hex-encoded SHA-256 hash of your plain text password. There are several options for setting it:
- In the remote server, in your OpenBazaar server directory, you can enter the command `go run openbazaard.go setapicreds` and follow the instructions.
- On Linux or Macintosh, you can use this command in your terminal: `echo -n yourpassword | sha256sum` (replace "yourpassword" with your actual password), and paste the hash into your config file.
- You can use an online hex generator (there are many options, just search for "create hex-encoded SHA-256 hash"), and paste the hash into your config file.

In the client, you should enter the plain text password in your server configuration.

If you are seeing the following error in your JS console:

For your protection, the client will only connect to a remote server via SSL. The above error indicates that your server is not set-up to run SSL.

To enable SSL on your remote server, follow this [doc](https://github.com/OpenBazaar/openbazaar-go/blob/master/docs/ssl.md).

You may also find this [guide to remote server security helpful.](https://github.com/OpenBazaar/openbazaar-go/blob/master/docs/security.md#basic-authentication)

When you install the OpenBazaar.crt file on your client machine, be sure to enable it as a trusted certificate.

On OSX, this is done via the Always Trust button.

On Windows, you should import the certificate using the [Microsoft Management Console.](http://www.thewindowsclub.com/manage-trusted-root-certificates-windows)

For Linux, please follow step 2 in the next section.

If you are seeing the following error in your JS console:

It is likely one of two things:

1. You may have not properly specified your server ip when generating the server.csr file. When following this [doc](https://github.com/OpenBazaar/openbazaar-go/blob/master/docs/ssl.md), be sure to replace \<server-ip\> with the ip of your remote server when executing this command `openssl req -new -key server.key -out server.csr `...

2. If you're running on Linux, that error could also indicate that the certificate needs to be added to the trusted list. Here's how to do it on Ubuntu ([detailed instructions](http://blog.tkassembled.com/410/adding-a-certificate-authority-to-the-trusted-list-in-ubuntu/)):
  - First, install libnss3-tools, which contains the certutil command: `sudo apt-get install libnss3-tools`
  - Copy the public certificate authority file to the certificate store: `sudo cp my_ca.crt /usr/share/ca-certificates/`
  - We’ll now recompile the SSL CA list, adding our certificate: `sudo dpkg-reconfigure ca-certificates`

    This will lead to a ncurses menu. In this menu, choose ask, and scroll through the long list of trusted CAs until you   find your ‘my_ca.crt’ certificate authority file. Mark it for inclusion with Space, then hit Tab then Enter to finish up.

  - Finally, execute `certutil -d sql:$HOME/.pki/nssdb -A -t "C,," -n "My Homemade CA" -i my_ca.crt`.

If on Linux you are seeing an "ERR_INSECURE_RESPONSE" error, it is likely because the OS does not recognize the certificate as a trusted certificate. Complete step 2 in the section above. Not having done the last bullet point in that section is the stumbling block for most Linux users.
